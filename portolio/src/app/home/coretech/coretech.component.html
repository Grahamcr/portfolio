How would you navigate the complex technology infrastructure of a global company who has existed for over 100 years?  What information do you need to be successful? How do you even get started and where do you go for questions along the way? '"

    [problem]="['GE was in the middle of being a corporation of managers who focused on making physical things, to a technology company of creators who needed to be empowered to create the digital solutions of tomorrow. This meant creating a self-service technology infrastructure request platform that would service the creation of the infrastructure required to support all of these new solutions. ']"
    [solution]="['CoreTech had already taken a first attempt at creating a solution for this problem, but found that it did not test well with users.  I conducted my own initial test of their solution and used the feedback to generate a B design to the Coretech design. This design ended up testing much better as matched the mental model users had going into the request process.  It also used best design principles to guide users through the process instead of forcing them navigate multiple data sources in order to complete a request. ']"
    [team]="['Our project team consisted of one UX Sr. Researcher (myself) and a business stakeholder from CoreTech who had reached out to the Innovation Studio (GE High Impact Technology Incubator) for help.']"
