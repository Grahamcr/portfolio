    [problem]="['Ford Algorithm Developers need access to very specific historical operational data in order to test changes and observe the Autonomous Vehicle fleet in real time to make observations and direct changes while the AV is operational.  Today they are leveraging cell phones to communicate with test drivers and complex database queries to multiple sources in order to retrieve historical data. ']"
    [solution]="['Retrieving historical data was simplified by creating a powerful advanced scenario search interface with favorites for even faster results when a developer is working on the same problem over a extended period of time.  Augmenting this data is a powerful trend dashboard allowing developers to catch insights faster.  A command center style map boosted morale and established a way to access real-time tracking information. ']"
    [team]="['The project team consisted of one UX Architect (myself) a development team of roughly four pairs of developers and one project manager. We were located on-site at Ford working closely with their AV development team.  The project ran one week long sprints with the design sprint running one sprint ahead of the development team.  My responsibilities included researching the direction of the product, developing testing plans, creating high fidelity mockups, collaborating with developers and the project manager. ']"
