                    <p class="sub-header first">My Elevator Pitch</p>
                    <p class="text">I take complex technical concepts and distill them into delightful user experiences to improve customer perception, employee effectiveness and user morale. My specialty is quickly translating research into value through iterative design, rapid prototyping and design sprints. I believe my portfolio demonstrates an ability to empathize with users and create beautiful visualizations and experiences users can relate to, enjoy and use efficiently. I received a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Grand Valley State University in 2012 and have been designing user experiences and developing software for such notable organizations as the National Security Agency, Booz Allen Hamilton and General Electric Company since then. </p>

                    <p class="sub-header">How I View UX</p>
                    <p class="text">I believe that UX shouldnâ€™t be confined to a screen and that is beneficial to take a step back and consider the entire experience of a user beyond the pixels they will manipulate. I believe that at is core the goal of UX is to improve the lives of others, whether it be through software, physical design or strategic vision. </p>

                    <p class="sub-header">User Advocate &amp; Storyteller</p>
                    <p class="text last">I am a storyteller with a passion for creating memorable stories which enable others to empathize with user's goals, needs and pain-points. It is my goal to use every tool in my repertoire to build a continuous understanding of an offerings users in order to create actionable insights for the benefit of the entire team and it's stakeholders.</p>
