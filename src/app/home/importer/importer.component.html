    [description]="'Imagine that you are an account manager responsible for maintaining the mobile environments for 10 or more companies each month. Each customer can have multiple accounts, some with only a few hundred lines and some with over 100,000. Every month it is your responsibility to load the invoices into your companies system, manage that data for accuracy and then use it to generate savings.  The more you save your customer the more your employer will earn (and ultimately the more you will get paid).  How would you break this task down into manageable steps and create an experience which will both improve the time to task completion and the accuracy of the data the process produces?'"

    [problem]="['Each month Account Managers at vMOX are required to optimize their customers cellular environments to ensure that the plans the customer is paying for meet, but do not exceed their needs.  The average Account Manager at vMOX manages anywhere from 6 to 10 customers, each who could have as many as five accounts and thousands of phone lines.  The first step in this process is to upload the customer’s invoice and map it into the vMOX system so the Account Manager can start the optimization process. Before my redesign of the importer it would take a Senior Account Manager an average of 25 minutes to upload a invoice.']"
    [solution]="['The Double Diamond approach I took to solving this challenge brought to the light the biggest challenge for Account Managers was trusting the system.  Account Managers did not believe the data they were looking at was accurate and that the system could be relied on to produce accurate calculations they could base decisions off of.  I was able to increase Account Manager trust in the system by giving them quick access to supporting data and displaying high level statistics throughout the process.  As a result, I was able to advocate for automating a lot of the importer process, which allowed the Account Managers to switch from fulling a role which required a lot of active engagement to one of a reviewer and approver of what the system had already done on their behalf.  The result is a faster and more accurate process which gives the Account Managers back time they can spend on meeting our customers needs in other ways. ']"

            <h3>THE RESEARCH</h3>
        
            <p>vMOX makes a profit by optimizing their customers cell phone plans according to the usage their employees encounter each month. For every dollar vMOX manages to save their customers they take a percentage of that savings as their own profit.  The first and arguably most important step in the optimizing process is to take the customer’s monthly invoice and accurately map it into the vMOX system so that data can be used to generate a new solution for that month.  Should parts of an invoice be loaded incorrectly the effects can be costly, including a loss of profit or a disruption of service for the customer.  </p>
            <p>The process of importing a bill is unfortunately not as simple as selecting a file on a computer and uploading it to the vMOX system.  Therefore, in order to make sure I understood both the current importer process and the goals/pain points of the Account Managers who import as many as 30 invoices a month I ran a one-week discovery sprint. During this time I interviewed five Account Managers, the Product Owner and the Director of Operations who oversees the Account Management team.  I organized the information from these interviews into three different artifacts: a Mind Map, a Story Map and two Personas. </p>

            <h3>HYPOTHESIS</h3>

            <p>The primary takeaway from my discovery research efforts was the <span class="bold"> emergence of multiple solution hypothesis</span>: 1) A System Guided Wizard Approach and 2) A Self Guided Workspace Approach.</p>
            <p>The invoice importer is a complex process, suggesting a Wizard would be beneficial design pattern as a Wizard intuitively takes a large complex task and breaks it down into smaller, more manageable bits.  However, Wizards have the draw back of becoming ineffective for tasks which are repeated often as users grow to no longer require the system to guide them through the process after having completed the same task so many times. Given Account Managers complete 30 or more invoice imports a month, a system guided Wizard approach may quickly become tedious.  </p>
            <p>It was also possible that users would be faster and more accurate over time with something closer to a workspace approach where they are given the ability to prioritize and complete their work in the way they see fit. While this may be a complex experience for a first-time user, a veteran Account Manager would be able to quickly manipulate the data using their expertise and not be hindered by the system working to hard to help them.  </p>
            <p>An issue which would be consistent with either approach was the users lack of trust in the system.  Our goal for this project was to increase the speed and accuracy which Account Managers could process complex invoices.  In order to meet those goals I was going to have to improve the relationship between the user and the system with the hopes of reducing the amount of human involvement required to process a bill.  The less engaged a user has to be and the more they can trust the system to take actions on their behalf the faster and more consistent the import process will be.</p>
            <p>The natural next step was to create a A/B Test to answer these outstanding questions.  To facilitate this a I created a test plan of scenarios based on the common tasks and goals I heard from users throughout the discovery process.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <app-imgexploder [imgsrc]="'assets/images/ImporterAssets/testKit.png'"></app-imgexploder>
            </div>

            <p>Using everything I had learned to this point I created two clickable in-browser mockups using Axure which my test participants could use to complete each of the scenarios outlined in the test plan.  The first mockup took the system guided wizard approach and focused on exposing supporting information to the user in order to facilitate trust.  The second mockup used a self guided workspace approach with system generated confidence scores to help build trust in the decisions made by the system. </p>

            </div>

            <p>Below you can find a video walk through of the two low fidelity mockups I created for testing.  You will see that a lot of the interaction was built out in order to drive as much feedback as possible. </p>

            </div>

            <p>Since vMOX is a distributed company where nearly everyone works remotely I conducted my A/B test remotely using screen share.  By observing the participants complete each of the scenarios outlined in the A/B Test Plan I was able evaluate which approach would best support the way they could work most efficiently.  I was surprised to see the results of the test indicate that all the participants felt strongly that a System-Guided Wizard approach would best fit their needs.  This conclusion was also backed up by the observation that participants were able to complete the assigned tasks more quickly using the System-Guided approach, regardless whether it was the first or second design they saw. </p>

            <p>Another interesting outcome of the test was the increasing amount of trust which I observed Account Managers had in the system.  This was evident by how much feedback I received regarding all the actionable and supporting information I had made visible throughout the process.  I believe that exposing this additional information made the Account Managers more comfortable accepting the conclusions the system generated as they had the information they needed to quickly validate its conclusions.  Even more importantly the majority of Account Managers who participated in the test supported changing the Wizard to a model where all decisions made by the system in each step were accepted by default instead of requiring the user to manually accept each decision either individually or in bulk.  The result of this change allowed me to create a process which would drastically reduce the workload and therefore time it took to complete an import.  You can see a complete list of the high-level takeaways from the A/B Test in the appendix below or in the attached documents of this homework submission. </p>

            <p>Using all of this valuable feedback I was able to combine the positive aspects from both designs to create a new high-fidelity mockup for the second iteration design.  This design focused on using the lessons learned from the A/B test to further build trust in the system and leverage that trust to create a process which could be completed quickly while producing accurate import results. </p>

            <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
            
            <p>The final solution focuses on three aspects, allowing the user to move fast using bulk data processing techniques, giving the account manager quick visibility to the information they need to make decisions and finally giving them a system that gives insights they can trust; allowing them to be more consistent and more efficient. I would love the opportunity to speak with you further about how I was able to leverage all of the great feedback I was given by users and stakeholders to balance user goals with business needs and make design decisions based on user data.  </p>

            <h3>CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED</h3>
            <p>The biggest challenge I faced with this challenge was working with the sheer complexity of the task the bill importer is responsible for completing. Looing back there are a couple of things I would have liked to have done different to help manage that complexity:</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Build more alignment between the different stakeholders as to what exactly the bill importer should do.</span>.  As we worked through the different iterations of the project a lot of time was spent going back and forth determining the exact technical requirements for the application.  Changing these requirements impacted the design, which then prolonged the project. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">Break the project down.</span> This was not an option as vMOX still works with a development model one might describe as ”Agilefall".  However in this case I wish that I had advocated more for breaking the project down into more manageable tasks after conducting the initial discovery research.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Started gathering feedback even earlier in the process.</span> I could have saved a lot of time if I had started getting feedback using paper prototypes or even using storyboards.  Instead of building out complex click through mockups I probably could have received enough direction to make decisions with much less effort.  Again, this would have been a challenge given the culture at vMOX, but I regret not trying. </p>
