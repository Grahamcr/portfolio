            <h4><a routerLink="/kiwi">The Kiwi Design System</a></h4>
            <p>After about a year after I became the very first designer at vMOX I started to advocate that we create a design system which could be used across all of the products that vMOX and itâ€™s sister company Advantage create.  My vision was eventually adopted as one of the five primary company-wide goals for 2019 and the Atomic Design System called Kiwi was born!</p>
